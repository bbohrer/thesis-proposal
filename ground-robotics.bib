abstract="This paper concerns recent progress on the computational complexity of decision methods and quantifier elimination methods for the first order theory of the reals. The paper begins with a quick introduction of terminology followed by a short survey of some complexity highlights. We then discuss ideas leading to the most (theoretically) efficient algorithms known. The discussion is necessarily simplistic as a rigorous development of the algorithms forces one to consider a myriad of details.",

In this paper we introduce yet another method for reducing the amount of computation which we will call partial CAD construction.",

title = "Human-inspired control logic for automated maneuvering of miniature helicopter",
abstract = "The maneuvering control logic that was developed to implement acrobatic maneuvers fully automatically on a miniature helicopter is described. The key component of this system is a state-machine maneuver execution logic that was inspired by an analysis of human pilot strategies. Conventional multivariable trim trajectory controllers were used before and on the exit from the maneuvers; bumpless transfer between these control modes was achieved through re-initialization of controller integrator states. Flight tests with this control logic demonstrated smooth maneuver entry, automatic recovery to a steady-state trim trajectory, and an ability to sequence maneuvers in a fully autonomous airshow-like sequence. This approach was flight tested with split-S, hammerhead, and 360-deg axial roll maneuvers, as well as a split-S-hamraerhead maneuver sequence. The maneuvering control logic can be used to automate a variety of other maneuvers.",
