    We introduce a first-order dynamic logic for reasoning
    about systems with discrete and continuous state
    transitions, and we present a sequent calculus for this
    logic. As a uniform model, our logic supports hybrid
    programs with discrete and differential actions. For
    handling real arithmetic during proofs, we lift
    quantifier elimination to dynamic logic. To obtain a
    modular combination, we use side deductions for
    verifying interacting dynamics. With this, our logic
    supports deductive verification of hybrid systems with
    symbolic parameters and first-order definable flows.
    Using our calculus, we prove a parametric inductive
    safety constraint for speed supervision in a train
    control system.}

Hoare's deductive system for proving partial correctness of sequential programs is extended to include the parallelism described by the language. The proof method lends insight into how one should understand and present parallel programs. Examples are given using several of the standard problems in the literature. Methods for proving termination and the absence of deadlock are also given.},

Flow* combines well-known Taylor model arithmetic techniques for guaranteed approximations of the continuous dynamics in each mode with a combination of approaches for handling mode invariants and discrete transitions. Flow* supports a wide variety of optimizations including adaptive step sizes, adaptive selection of approximation orders and the heuristic selection of template directions for aggregating flowpipes. This paper describes Flow* and demonstrates its performance on a series of non-linear continuous and hybrid system benchmarks. Our comparisons show that Flow* is competitive with other tools.},

abstract = {Boogie is an intermediate verification language, designed to make the prescription of verification conditions natural and convenient. It serves as a common intermediate representation for static program verifiers of various source languages, and it abstracts over the interfaces to various theorem provers. Boogie can also be used as a shared input and output format for techniques like abstract interpretation and predicate abstraction. As a language, Boogie has both mathematical and imperative components. The imperative components of Boogie specify sets of execution traces, the states of which are described and constrained by the mathematical components. The language includes features like parametric polymorphism, partial orders, logical quantifications, nondeterminism, total expressions, partial statements, and flexible control flow. The Boogie language was previously known as BoogiePL. This paper is a reference manual for Boogie version 2.},

  abstract  = {
    Aircraft collision avoidance maneuvers are important
    and complex applications. Curved flight exhibits
    nontrivial continuous behavior. In combination with the
    control choices during air traffic maneuvers, this
    yields hybrid systems with challenging interactions of
    discrete and continuous dynamics. As a case study
    illustrating the use of a new proof assistant for a
    logic for nonlinear hybrid systems, we analyze
    collision freedom of roundabout maneuvers in air
    traffic control, where appropriate curved flight, good
    timing, and compatible maneuvering are crucial for
    guaranteeing safe spatial separation of aircraft
    throughout their flight. We show that formal
    verification of hybrid systems can scale to curved
    flight maneuvers required in aircraft control
    applications. We introduce a fully flyable variant of
    the roundabout collision avoidance maneuver and verify
    safety properties by compositional verification.}

  abstract  = {
    Complex physical systems have several degrees of
    freedom. They only work correctly when their control
    parameters obey corresponding constraints. Based on the
    informal specification of the European Train Control
    System (ETCS), we design a controller for its
    cooperation protocol. For its free parameters, we
    successively identify constraints that are required to
    ensure collision freedom. We formally prove the
    parameter constraints to be sharp by characterizing
    them equivalently in terms of reachability properties
    of the hybrid system dynamics. Using our deductive
    verification tool KeYmaera, we formally verify
    controllability, safety, liveness, and reactivity
    properties of the ETCS protocol that entail collision
    freedom. We prove that the ETCS protocol remains
    correct even in the presence of perturbation by
    disturbances in the dynamics. We verify that safety is
    preserved when a PI controlled speed supervision is
    used.}
