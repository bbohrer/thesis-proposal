    In this thesis we examine the possibility of
    automatically constructing the program specification
    from an implementation, both from a theoretical
    perspective and as a practical approach with a sequent
    calculus. As a setting for program specifications we
    choose dynamic logic for the Java programming language.
    We show that---despite the undecidable nature of
    program analysis---the strongest specification of any
    program can always be constructed algorithmically.
    Further we outline a practical approach embedded into a
    sequent calculus for dynamic logic and with a higher
    focus on readability. Therefor, the central aspect of
    describing unbounded state changes incorporates the
    concept of modifies lists for expressing the modifiable
    portion of the state space. The underlying deductions
    are carried out by the theorem prover of the KeY
    System.

  abstract  = {
    With the goal of this thesis being to create a dynamic
    logic for object-oriented languages, ODL is developed
    along with a sound and relatively complete calculus.
    The dynamic logic contains only the absolute logical
    essentials of object-orientation, yet still allows a
    ``natural'' representation of all other features of
    common object-oriented programming languages. ODL is an
    extension of a dynamic logic for imperative While
    programs by function modification and dynamic type
    checks. A generalisation of substitutions, called
    updates, constitute the central technical device for
    dealing with object aliasing arising from function
    modification and for retaining a manageable calculus in
    practical application scenarios. Further, object
    enumerators realise object creation in a natural yet
    powerful way. Finally, completeness is proven relative
    to first-order arithmetic. Along with the soundness
    result, this proof constitutes the central part of this
    thesis and even copes with states containing
    uncomputable functions.},

    sequent calculus for this logic. In conjunction with
    dynamically typed object enumerators, non-rigid
    functions allow to embed notions of object-orientation
    in dynamic logic, thereby forming a basis for
    verification of object-oriented programs. A semantical
    generalisation of substitutions, called state update,
    which we add to the logic, constitutes the central
    technical device for dealing with object aliasing
    during function modification. With these few
    extensions, our dynamic logic captures the essential
    aspects of the complex verification system KeY and,
    hence, constitutes a foundation for object-oriented
    verification with the principles of reasoning that
    underly the successful KeY case studies.},

    We introduce a hybrid variant of a dynamic logic with

    satisfaction operators, this hybrid logic provides
    improved system introspection by referring to

    reasoning as a paradigm for delaying expansion of

    With these extensions, our hybrid dynamic logic
    advances the capabilities for compositional reasoning
    about (semialgebraic) hybrid dynamic systems. Moreover,
    the constructive reasoning support for goal-oriented
    analytic verification of hybrid dynamic systems carries
    over from the base calculus to our extended calculus.},

   In this paper, we present an abstraction refinement

   faithful embedding of bounded model checking for systems
   of timed automata into propositional logic with linear
   arithmetic and prove correctness. With this logical
   representation, we achieve a linear-size representation
   of parallel composition and introduce a quick
   abstraction technique that works uniformly for clocks,
   events, and states. When necessary, abstractions are
   refined by analysing spurious counterexamples using a
   promising extension of counterexample-guided abstraction
   refinement with syntactic information about Craig
   interpolants. To support generalisations, our overall
   approach identifies the algebraic and logical principles
   required for logic-based abstraction refinement.}

    Hybrid systems are models for complex physical systems
    and are defined as dynamical systems with interacting
    discrete transitions and continuous evolutions along
    differential equations. With the goal of developing a
    theoretical and practical foundation for deductive
    verification of hybrid systems, we introduce a dynamic
    logic for hybrid programs, which is a program notation
    for hybrid systems. As a verification technique that is
    suitable for automation, we introduce a free variable
    proof calculus with a novel combination of real-valued
    free variables and Skolemisation for lifting quantifier
    elimination for real arithmetic to dynamic logic. The
    calculus is compositional, i.e., it reduces properties
    of hybrid programs to properties of their parts. Our
    main result proves that this calculus axiomatises the
    transition behaviour of hybrid systems completely
    relative to differential equations. In a case study
    with cooperating traffic agents of the European Train
    Control System, we further show that our calculus is
    well-suited for verifying realistic hybrid systems with
    parametric system dynamics.

    Recently, there has been considerable interest in the
    use of Model Checking for Systems Biology.
    Unfortunately, the state space of stochastic biological
    models is often too large for classical Model Checking
    techniques. For these models, a statistical approach to
    Model Checking has been shown to be an effective
    alternative. Extending our earlier work, we present the
    first algorithm for performing statistical Model
    Checking using Bayesian Sequential Hypothesis Testing.
    We show that our Bayesian approach outperforms current
    statistical Model Checking techniques, which rely on
    tests from Classical (aka Frequentist) statistics, by
    requiring fewer system simulations. Another advantage
    of our approach is the ability to incorporate prior
    Biological knowledge about the model being verified. We
    demonstrate our algorithm on a variety of models from
    the Systems Biology literature and show that it enables
    faster verification than state-of-the-art techniques,
    even when no prior knowledge is available.}

  abstract  = {
    Complex physical systems have several degrees of
    freedom. They only work correctly when their control
    parameters obey corresponding constraints. Based on the
    informal specification of the European Train Control
    System (ETCS), we design a controller for its
    cooperation protocol. For its free parameters, we
    successively identify constraints that are required to
    ensure collision freedom. We formally prove the
    parameter constraints to be sharp by characterizing
    them equivalently in terms of reachability properties
    of the hybrid system dynamics. Using our deductive
    verification tool KeYmaera, we formally verify
    controllability, safety, liveness, and reactivity
    properties of the ETCS protocol that entail collision
    freedom. We prove that the ETCS protocol remains
    correct even in the presence of perturbation by
    disturbances in the dynamics. We verify that safety is
    preserved when a PI controlled speed supervision is
    used.}

    We address the problem of model checking stochastic
    systems, i.e. checking whether a stochastic system
    satisfies a certain temporal property with a
    probability greater (or smaller) than a fixed
    threshold. In particular, we present a novel
    Statistical Model Checking (SMC) approach based on
    Bayesian statistics. We show that our approach is
    feasible for hybrid systems with stochastic
    transitions, a generalization of Simulink/Stateflow
    models. Standard approaches to stochastic (discrete)
    systems require numerical solutions for large
    optimization problems and quickly become infeasible
    with larger state spaces. Generalizations of these
    techniques to hybrid systems with stochastic effects
    are even more challenging. The SMC approach was
    pioneered by Younes and Simmons in the discrete and
    non-Bayesian case. It solves the verification problem
    by combining randomized sampling of system traces
    (which is very efficient for Simulink/Stateflow) with
    hypothesis testing or estimation. We believe SMC is
    essential for scaling up to large Stateflow/Simulink
    models. While the answer to the verification problem is
    not guaranteed to be correct, we prove that Bayesian
    SMC can make the probability of giving a wrong answer
    arbitrarily small. The advantage is that answers can
    usually be obtained much faster than with standard,
    exhaustive model checking techniques. We apply our
    Bayesian SMC approach to a representative example of
    stochastic discrete-time hybrid system models in
    Stateflow/Simulink: a fuel control system featuring
    hybrid behavior and fault tolerance. We show that our
    technique enables faster verification than
    state-of-the-art statistical techniques, while
    retaining the same error bounds. We emphasize that
    Bayesian SMC is by no means restricted to
    Stateflow/Simulink models: we have in fact successfully
    applied it to very large stochastic models from Systems
    Biology.}

    We address a fundamental mismatch between the
    combinations of dynamics that occur in complex physical
    systems and the limited kinds of dynamics supported in
    analysis. Modern applications combine communication,
    computation, and control. They may even form dynamic
    networks, where neither structure nor dimension stay
    the same while the system follows mixed discrete and
    continuous dynamics.

     We provide the logical foundations for closing this
    analytic gap. We develop a system model for distributed
    hybrid systems that combines quantified differential
    equations with quantified assignments and dynamic
    dimensionality-changes. We introduce a dynamic logic
    for verifying distributed hybrid systems and present a
    proof calculus for it. We prove that this calculus is a
    sound and complete axiomatization of the behavior of
    distributed hybrid systems relative to quantified
    differential equations. In our calculus we have proven
    collision freedom in distributed car control even when
    new cars may appear dynamically on the road.}

    We address the verification problem for distributed
    hybrid systems with nontrivial dynamics. Consider air
    traffic collision avoidance maneuvers, for example.
    Verifying dynamic appearance of aircraft during an
    ongoing collision avoidance maneuver is a longstanding
    and essentially unsolved problem. The resulting systems
    are not hybrid systems and their state space is not of
    the form R^n. They are distributed hybrid systems with
    nontrivial continuous and discrete dynamics in
    distributed state spaces whose dimension and topology
    changes dynamically over time. We present the first
    formal verification technique that can handle the
    complicated nonlinear dynamics of these systems. We
    introduce quantified differential invariants, which are
    properties that can be checked for invariance along the
    dynamics of the distributed hybrid system based on
    differentiation, quantified substitution, and
    quantifier elimination in real-closed fields. This
    gives a computationally attractive technique, because
    it works without having to solve the
    infinite-dimensional differential equation systems
    underlying distributed hybrid systems. We formally
    verify a roundabout maneuver in which aircraft can
    appear dynamically.}

    Logic is a powerful tool for analyzing and verifying
    systems, including programs, discrete systems,
    real-time systems, hybrid systems, and distributed
    systems. Some applications also have a stochastic
    behavior, however, either because of fundamental
    properties of nature, uncertain environments, or
    simplifications to overcome complexity. Discrete
    probabilistic systems have been studied using logic.
    But logic has been chronically underdeveloped in the
    context of stochastic hybrid systems, i.e., systems
    with interacting discrete, continuous, and stochastic
    dynamics. We aim at overcoming this deficiency and
    introduce a dynamic logic for stochastic hybrid
    systems. Our results indicate that logic is a
    promising tool for understanding stochastic hybrid
    systems and can help taming some of their complexity.
    We introduce a compositional model for stochastic
    hybrid systems. We prove adaptivity, cadlag, and
    Markov time properties, and prove that the semantics
    of our logic is measurable. We present compositional
    proof rules, including rules for stochastic
    differential equations, and prove soundness.

    Hybrid systems are models for complex physical systems
    and have become a widely used concept for understanding
    their behavior. Many applications are safety-critical,
    including car, railway, and air traffic control,
    robotics, physical-chemical process control, and
    biomedical devices. Hybrid systems analysis studies how
    we can build computerised controllers for physical
    systems which are guaranteed to meet their design
    goals. The continuous dynamics of hybrid systems can be
    modeled by differential equations, the discrete
    dynamics by a combination of discrete state-transitions
    and conditional execution. The discrete and continuous
    dynamics interact to form hybrid systems, which makes
    them quite challenging for verification.

     In this tutorial, we survey state-of-the-art
    verification techniques for hybrid systems. In
    particular, we focus on a coherent logical approach for
    systematic hybrid systems analysis. We survey theory,
    practice, and applications, and show how hybrid systems
    can be verified in the hybrid systems verification tool
    KeYmaera. KeYmaera has been used successfully to verify
    safety, reactivity, controllability, and liveness
    properties, including collision freedom in air traffic,
    car, and railway control systems. It has also been used
    to verify properties of electrical circuits. }

    The biggest challenge in hybrid systems verification is
    the handling of differential equations. Because
    computable closed-form solutions only exist for very
    simple differential equations, proof certificates have
    been proposed for more scalable verification. Search
    procedures for these proof certificates are still rather
    ad-hoc, though, because the problem structure is only
    understood poorly. We investigate differential
    invariants, which define an induction principle for
    differential equations and which can be checked for
    invariance along a differential equation just by using
    their differential structure, without having to solve
    them. We study the structural properties of differential
    invariants. To analyze trade-offs for proof search
    complexity, we identify more than a dozen relations
    between several classes of differential invariants and
    compare their deductive power. As our main results, we
    analyze the deductive power of differential cuts and the
    deductive power of differential invariants with
    auxiliary differential variables. We refute the
    differential cut elimination hypothesis and show that,
    unlike standard cuts, differential cuts are fundamental
    proof principles that strictly increase the deductive
    power. We also prove that the deductive power increases
    further when adding auxiliary differential variables to
    the dynamics.

    We study the logic of dynamical systems, that is,
    logics and proof principles for properties of dynamical
    systems. Dynamical systems are mathematical models
    describing how the state of a system evolves over time.
    They are important in modeling and understanding many
    applications, including embedded systems and
    cyber-physical systems. In discrete dynamical systems,
    the state evolves in discrete steps, one step at a
    time, as described by a difference equation or discrete
    state transition relation. In continuous dynamical
    systems, the state evolves continuously along a
    function, typically described by a differential
    equation. Hybrid dynamical systems or hybrid systems
    combine both discrete and continuous dynamics.

     This is a brief survey of differential dynamic logic
    for specifying and verifying properties of hybrid
    systems. We explain hybrid system models, differential
    dynamic logic, its semantics, and its axiomatization
    for proving logical formulas about hybrid systems. We
    study differential invariants, i.e., induction
    principles for differential equations. We briefly
    survey theoretical results, including soundness and
    completeness and deductive power. Differential dynamic
    logic has been implemented in automatic and interactive
    theorem provers and has been used successfully to
    verify safety-critical applications in automotive,
    aviation, railway, robotics, and analogue electrical
    circuits.}

    Hybrid systems are a fusion of continuous dynamical
    systems and discrete dynamical systems. They freely
    combine dynamical features from both worlds. For that
    reason, it has often been claimed that hybrid systems
    are more challenging than continuous dynamical systems
    and than discrete systems. We now show that,
    proof-theoretically, this is not the case. We present a
    complete proof-theoretical alignment that interreduces
    the discrete dynamics and the continuous dynamics of
    hybrid systems. We give a sound and complete
    axiomatization of hybrid systems relative to continuous
    dynamical systems and a sound and complete
    axiomatization of hybrid systems relative to discrete
    dynamical systems. Thanks to our axiomatization,
    proving properties of hybrid systems is exactly the
    same as proving properties of continuous dynamical
    systems and again, exactly the same as proving
    properties of discrete dynamical systems. This
    fundamental cornerstone sheds light on the nature of
    hybridness and enables flexible and provably perfect
    combinations of discrete reasoning with continuous
    reasoning that lift to all aspects of hybrid systems
    and their fragments.}

    Statistical Model Checking (SMC) is a computationally
    very efficient verification technique based on
    selective system sampling. One well identified
    shortcoming of SMC is that, unlike probabilistic model
    checking, it cannot be applied to systems featuring
    nondeterminism, such as Markov Decision Processes
    (MDP). We address this limitation by developing an
    algorithm that resolves nondeterminism
    probabilistically, and then uses multiple rounds of
    sampling and Reinforcement Learning to provably
    improve resolutions of nondeterminism with respect to
    satisfying a Bounded Linear Temporal Logic (BLTL)
    property. Our algorithm thus reduces an MDP to a fully
    probabilistic Markov chain on which SMC may be applied
    to give an approximate solution to the problem of
    checking the probabilistic BLTL property. We integrate
    our algorithm in a parallelised modification of the
    PRISM simulation framework. Extensive validation with
    both new and PRISM benchmarks demonstrates that the
    approach scales very well in scenarios where symbolic
    algorithms fail to do so.}

        We address the problem of model checking
        stochastic systems, i.e., checking whether a
        stochastic system satisfies a certain temporal
        property with a probability greater (or smaller)
        than a fixed threshold. In particular, we present
        a Statistical Model Checking (SMC) approach based
        on Bayesian statistics. We show that our approach
        is feasible for a certain class of hybrid systems
        with stochastic transitions, a generalization of
        Simulink/Stateflow models. Standard approaches to
        stochastic discrete systems require numerical
        solutions for large optimization problems and
        quickly become infeasible with larger state
        spaces. Generalizations of these techniques to
        hybrid systems with stochastic effects are even
        more challenging. The SMC approach was pioneered
        by Younes and Simmons in the discrete and
        non-Bayesian case. It solves the verification
        problem by combining randomized sampling of system
        traces (which is very efficient for
        Simulink/Stateflow) with hypothesis testing (i.e.,
        testing against a probability threshold) or
        estimation (i.e., computing with high probability
        a value close to the true probability). We believe
        SMC is essential for scaling up to large
        Stateflow/Simulink models. While the answer to the
        verification problem is not guaranteed to be
        correct, we prove that Bayesian SMC can make the
        probability of giving a wrong answer arbitrarily
        small. The advantage is that answers can usually
        be obtained much faster than with standard,
        exhaustive model checking techniques. We apply our
        Bayesian SMC approach to a representative example
        of stochastic discrete-time hybrid system models
        in Stateflow/Simulink: a fuel control system
        featuring hybrid behavior and fault tolerance. We
        show that our technique enables faster
        verification than state-of-the-art statistical
        techniques. We emphasize that Bayesian SMC is by
        no means restricted to Stateflow/Simulink models.
        It is in principle applicable to a variety of
        stochastic models from other domains, e.g.,
        systems biology.

  We consider an adaptive cruise control system
in which control decisions are made based on position
and velocity information received from other vehicles
via V2V wireless communication. If the vehicles
follow each other at a close distance, they have
better wireless reception but collisions may occur
when a follower car does not receive notice about the
decelerations of the leader car fast enough to react
before it is too late. If the vehicles are farther
apart, they would have a bigger safety margin, but
the wireless communication drops out more often, so
that the follower car no longer receives what the
leader car is doing. In order to guarantee safety,
such a system must return control to the driver if it
does not receive an update from a nearby vehicle
within some timeout period. The value of this timeout
parameter encodes a tradeoff between the likelihood
that an update is received and the maximum safe
acceleration. Combining formal verification
techniques for hybrid systems with a wireless
communication model, we analyze how the expected
efficiency of a provably-safe adaptive cruise control
syst em is affected by the value of this timeout.

  abstract = {\emph{Cyber-physical systems} (CPS) combine cyber aspects
               such as communication and computer control with physical
               aspects such as movement in space, which arise frequently in
               many safety-critical application domains, including aviation,
               automotive, railway, and robotics. But how can we ensure that
               these systems are guaranteed to meet their design goals, e.g.,
               that an aircraft will not crash into another one?
               
               This paper highlights some of the most fascinating aspects of
               cyber-physical systems and their dynamical systems models,
               such as hybrid systems that combine discrete transitions and
               continuous evolution along differential equations. Because of
               the impact that they can have on the real world, CPSs
               deserve proof as safety evidence.
               
               \emph{Multi-dynamical systems} understand complex systems
               as a combination of multiple elementary dynamical aspects,
               which makes them natural mathematical models for CPS,
               since they tame their complexity by compositionality.
               The family of \emph{differential dynamic logics} achieves
               this compositionality by providing compositional logics,
               programming languages, and reasoning principles for CPS.
               Differential dynamic logics, as implemented in the theorem
               prover KeYmaera X, have been instrumental in verifying many
               applications, including the Airborne Collision Avoidance
               System ACAS X, the European Train Control System ETCS,
               automotive systems, mobile robot navigation, and a surgical
               robot system for skull-base surgery. This combination of
               strong theoretical foundations with practical theorem proving
               challenges and relevant applications makes
               \emph{Logic for CPS} an ideal area for compelling
               and rewarding research.}
